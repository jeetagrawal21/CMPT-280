Q2)

O(1) because as wee see the above table shows that the time complexity is almost constant.

Q3)

O(log(n)) because as the item increases the time complexity increases and as it is a tree the time complexity is logarithmic.

Q4)

I would use treeQuest log because the entries are already sorted in the tree while the hash log calls the sort algorithm which has O(nlog(n)).

Q5)

I would go with the hash log because hash would take less time as the big-O is O(1).

THE END.
